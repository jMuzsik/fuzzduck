My very important personal site with lot's of unnessesary stuff within it.

## It's a piece of magic, just like Wordsworth:

``` sql
"Rites which attest that Man by nature
  lies
Bedded for good and evil in gulf
Fearfully low; nor will your judgement
  scorn
Those services, whereby attempt is made
To lift the creature toward that eminence
On which, now fallen, erewhile in majesty
He stood; or if not so, whose top serene
At least he feels 't is given him to descry;
Not without aspirations; evermore
Returning, and injunctions from within
Doubt to cast off and weariness, if glory lost,
May be, through pains and persevering
  hope,
Recovered; or, if hitherto unknown,
Lies within reach, and one day shall be
  gained."
```
